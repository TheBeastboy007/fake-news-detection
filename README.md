# 🧠 Fake News Detection System

An AI-powered, Dockerized microservices project that detects whether a news article is real or fake using machine learning techniques. The project features an interactive frontend dashboard and robust backend with circuit breaker support for fault tolerance.

## 🔍 Overview

This system leverages machine learning and microservices to analyze news articles and classify them as **Real** or **Fake**.  
It consists of five main components, each running in its own Docker container:

- **AI Model Microservice (FastAPI)**: Predicts whether the news is fake or real.
- **Data Collection Microservice (Flask)**: Stores submitted news articles for future retraining.
- **API Gateway (FastAPI)**: Routes requests between frontend and backend with built-in **Circuit Breaker**.
- **Dashboard (Flask)**: Modern UI for users to input news content and view predictions with confidence score.
- **ML Pipeline**: Built with Scikit-learn using Logistic Regression, achieving over 95% accuracy.
